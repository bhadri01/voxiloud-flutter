# voxiloud

A new Flutter project.

## TODO

```
[x] Change the app name from voxiloud to Voxiloud 

[x] Change the feature names in home page from 
"Input/paste" to "Text to Speech",
"Convert your text to audio" to "Convert your text to speech",
"upload documents" to "Documents to Text"
"Translate your words" to "Translate your Text"
And same title names should reflect as page header when we go into those screens too.

[x] In recent activities, we are displaying labels of recent activities like tts, translate and docs change them to TTS, Translation and Document to Text

[ ] In TTS screen, whatever voices options i select, it's always the same for meðŸ¤” a lady voice! This needs to be revisited! And voices options should be made user understandable 

[ ] And there is option to download audio in TTS, but when we download audio it saves in local but we are right now not displaying that as downloaded audios in any screens ðŸ¤”@Lavanya Client I think we initially planned to show both downloaded audios and saved files in Saved screen!

[ ] And while downloading audio, Can we ask user for name to save while downloading audio?? Currently it's saving in a name as _data_user_0_com.example.voxiloud_app_flutter_Music_voxiloud_audio1 all the time, name itself needs to changed and it's better to ask for name from user

[ ] Also, audio saved from uploaded documents are not playable sometimes needs to check 
that (I'll share the file I tried later)

[x] While saving, there is a default value as "Title" for name instead of being there as a placeholder and we are able to click save without editing it. We should not allow user to do that, it's mandatory for input value, this should be same in case of downloading audio files too

[x] Continuation of point#8 , in case we save files with title as name , in saved files it is displayed as grey screen for that file but no contents are picked up.

[ ] (Better to have) - while searching for languages in translate screen, it will be good to have "search-as-you-type"

[x] In settings -> TTS settings - instead of displaying options like primary/secondary background color or foreground colors we can display it like 
Paragraph highlight color
Paragraph text color
Word highlight color
Word text color

[x] In translate screen in between languages there is reverable icon displayed, instead it's should be only 'to' icon

[ ] Also in settings can we give a section to Rate us which should open our app in Play Store for rating and Share Us, which should give the app play store link to copy and also show options of whatsapp, sms, etc
